# A simple Tetris game code with players name and score getting stored in database 

•	Game Description:
         Tetris or tetromino is an interesting game of blocks.  Differently shaped blocks (each made up of four boxes) fall from the top of the screen, and the player must guide them down to form complete rows that have no gaps in them.  When a complete row is formed, the row disappears and each row above it moves down one row.  The player tries to keep forming  complete lines until the screen fills up and a new falling block cannot fit on the screen.  The board is made up of 10*20 spaces that the blocks fall and stack up in.  The piece or block can be rotated and positioned.  The shapes of the pieces are T,S,Z,J,I,L and O.  The pieces will come in five colors: blue, brown, pink, red and green.  Every time the player pushes the left or right arrow key, the falling piece should move one box over to the left or right. The up arrow key will rotate the falling piece to its next rotation.  If the down arrow key is pressed, then the player wants the piece to fall faster than normal.

•	Cases of scoring points:
        If the player guides the pieces to form a complete row without gaps then he will get a score of 1 and the row will disappear with each row above it moving down.  For each completion of a row the player will score an additional point.  The scoreboard of the player will be visible in the screen.  If the screen fills up then the board shows “game over” and asks the player to press escape to play again.  


        
•	Input and Output format:
         The player has to give his name as input before starting the game.  This name will be stored in the database.  The output of the game is the scoreboard displayed on the screen.

•	Database description:
          The database consists of two rows of names and score.  The names consist of the first to last player who have played the game.  The scorecard gives their respective scores.
